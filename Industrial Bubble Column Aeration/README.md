This project was one of several experiments and process optimizations performed at a pilot plant through Denmark Technical University in 2019. Pilot plants are an intermediate between laboratory and large scale industrial operations, where prospective processes are evaluated in preparation for future scale up. In this experiment, a bubble aeration column, which uses bacteria to carry out a chemical reaction, had different conditions varied to develop a first approximation understanding of how the reaction was carried out. For a complete optimization, coefficients of each variable's effect on the reaction rate, along with their cost and the value of the unit's products, would need to be developed for use in an objective function.
